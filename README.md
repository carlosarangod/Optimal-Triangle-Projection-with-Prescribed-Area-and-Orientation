# Optimal-Triangle-Projection-with-Prescribed-Area-and-Orientation
This is the companion code of "Mean Oriented Riesz Features for Micro Expression ClassificationAn Optimal Triangle Projector with Prescribed Area and Orientation,
Application to Position-Based Dynamics". In this project, we implement an algebraic procedure to find the optimal solution for the problem of finding the closest triangle under prescribed area and orientation. We adapt our method to implement PBD (point based dynamycs), for 2D mesh editing and compare its performance with respect to the existing PBD implementation with linearisation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This method was implemented in Matlab although it can be easily adapted to different programming languages
